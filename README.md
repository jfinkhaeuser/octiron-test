# octiron-test
An [octiron](https://github.com/jfinkhaeuser/octiron) event interface for software test cases

The gem provides event definitions for event classes typically useful in
automated software testing. The main event class is one encapsulating test
failures/errors.

There's so little code in this gem, it's not worth documenting. Just check out
the `lib` subdirectory.
